    This toong seems to be a remix of Glowstick City in a Yamaha YM2612 style.

      Woah

      Y'all ready to get golfing up in here?
<br>
      Oh yeah baby~, oh yes~ (I have started regretting transcribing this)
<br>
      Oh my god~, this is so golftacular, my god
<br>
      Alright guys, you ready for this
<br>
      I'm the uncanny cat and I think golfing is cool
<br>
      I golf all the time because I like it ???
<br>
      Golfing is awesome, golfing is rad
<br>
      I wouldn't be golfing if it was bad
<br>
      This song's going too fast, hang on, slow down
<br>
      Where did I put the- oh god no, the lyrics ???ed
<br>
      Oh no, this is bad, this is bad, where did they go
<br>
      Oh my god, this is awful, this is going so horribly wrong
<br>
      This is no longer golftacular what do I do guys
<br>
      (glass breaking SFX) Oh! Oh god help! Help, I fell down the stairs (Nvm, I'm not regretting this)
<br>
      Oh god, I think I broke 20 bones
<br>
      Oh my goodness gracious me
<br>
      Oh this is horrible
<br>
      This is the worst day of my life, my entire life

      Who wrote these lyrics? These lyrics suck!
<br>
      I wanna speak to who wrote this, and I wanna.....
<br>
      I wanna put them into an boiling pot of cheese, and hot sauce,
<br>
      And then I wanna stir up the bowl
<br>
      And I wanna eat them, or something
<br>
      These lyrics arent uncanny, they're just bad
<br>
      This's a bad song
<br>
