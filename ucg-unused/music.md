    This toong seems to be a remix of Glowstick City in a Yamaha YM2612 style.

      Woah

      Y'all ready to get golfing up in here?

      Oh yeah baby~, oh yes~ (I have started regretting transcribing this)

      Oh my god~, this is so golftacular, my god

      Alright guys, you ready for this

      I'm the uncanny cat and I think golfing is cool

      I golf all the time because I like it ???

      Golfing is awesome, golfing is rad

      I wouldn't be golfing if it was bad

      This song's going too fast, hang on, slow down

      Where did I put the- oh god no, the lyrics ???ed

      Oh no, this is bad, this is bad, where did they go

      Oh my god, this is awful, this is going so horribly wrong

      This is no longer golftacular what do I do guys

      (glass breaking SFX) Oh! Oh god help! Help, I fell down the stairs (Nvm, I'm not regretting this)

      Oh god, I think I broke 20 bones

      Oh my goodness gracious me

      Oh this is horrible

      This is the worst day of my life, my entire life

      This is not one for the (ages, eigthies?)

      Oh hang on, i found the lyrics, oh thanks i'm good

      Lets do this

      (three?)

      Golfing is the best thing since sliced bread

      If i didn't golf, I'm pretty sure I'd be dead

      Oh, oh, oh, yeah?

      Oh, oh, yeah?

      Yeah, oh, woo?

      Woo, yeah, oh, yeah, woo

      Golf

      The ???, what ?????

      Who wrote these lyrics? These lyrics suck!

      I wanna speak to who wrote this, and I wanna.....

      I wanna put them into an boiling pot of cheese, and hot sauce,

      And then I wanna stir up the bowl

      And I wanna eat them, or something

      These lyrics arent uncanny, they're just bad

      This's a bad song

      How much am I getting payed for this?

      This...sucks.

      Oh! Oh my god!

      end of song
