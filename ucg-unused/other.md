### Levels
 - 4-11: The Wall
![Screenshot of level 4-11](assets/images/screenshots/4-11.png)
This level contains `epicdoor.png` and `lock.png`. The goal is out of bounds and so is an uncanny cat, which eventually gets inbounds. This level is unaccessable in the base game due to it not being loaded and it having the music set to "bgmNothing" (which doesn't exist) instead of "nothing"
